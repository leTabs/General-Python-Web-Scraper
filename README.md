# General-Python-Web-Scraper

A web scraper created with python.
Unlike other web scrapers, this is not specific to a website.
In other words, by submiting the url, a tag and it's class's name, 
the user is able to view the data.
So, in order to make use of this program this details must be know by the user.

For the web scraper's complition are required:
1) The requests module, 
2) The bs4 module (BeautifulSoup4),
3) The pathlib module, 
4) An html parser (i used html.parser) 
Note: this parsers can be installed with pip.
Additional (optional modules, for better accessibility):
1) sys module 
2) time module
