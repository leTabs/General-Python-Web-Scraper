This is a General Web Scraper, created using Python.
It allows for users with minimum HTML knowledge, to scrape data from 
web pages by a very simple and quick process.

All it requires is:
1) The URL Address of the Web page
2) The HTML tag(s)
3) The name of the tag's class ( Optional )

By providing the above neccessities, the program returns the data in an indexed form.
It also allows for the option to store the data in files.
